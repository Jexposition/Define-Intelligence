# A formal review of the OpenAI Navier–Stokes blow-up claim

## Abstract

This paper evaluates whether the public Lean development establishes the
mathematical construction described in OpenAI's Navier–Stokes paper and
whether that construction satisfies the forced alternatives in Charles
Fefferman's Clay Mathematics Institute formulation. The review separates
kernel validity, endpoint specification, and paper-to-code correspondence.

The inspected endpoint is not refuted by a compiler error or by the use of an
external force. The repository contains a genuine five-coordinate upstream
moment repair, a selected forced candidate, and a standard-axiom-only
dependency report for the inspected headline declarations. The decisive
adverse result is narrower: the exported `selected_witness` does not expose a
field-level equality identifying the paper's $(M,I,J,S,C_p)$ moments with the
selected velocity, pressure, residual, and force. A zero-sorry probe proves
that the witness type does not entail an arbitrary five-moment certificate.

That is a load-bearing correspondence failure, not yet a derivation of
`False`. The present verdict is therefore **not established as a CMI
solution** and **not formally refuted**. A formal refutation requires a
zero-sorry contradiction on the selected dependency path or a false mandatory
premise proved for the selected fields.

## A selected-path obstruction to residual cancellation

The force objection can be made precise without assuming that velocity blow-up
automatically implies force blow-up. The selected witness supplies an interior
identity

$$
\mathcal R(u,p)(t,x)=f(t,x),\qquad 0<t<1,
$$

and the selected schedule supplies unbounded mixed velocity at the origin. The
new zero-sorry probe also proves that the corresponding selected mixed
residual tends to zero at that endpoint. Independently, the candidate
interface identifies its interior Navier–Stokes residual with the force. The
probe proves that these facts contradict any selected-field estimate

$$
c\lVert u(t,0)\rVert\leq\lVert\mathcal R(u,p)(t,0)\rVert
$$

with fixed $c>0$, provided the force is locally bounded near $1$. This is the
correct mathematical target for the force-smoothness attack.

The selected raw residual actually falsifies the proposed lower-bound premise:
its norm tends to zero while the origin speed diverges. A second zero-sorry
probe now composes that result with the final selected force. Late-time
activation is removed, the periodic and original residuals agree at the
origin, and the selected force therefore satisfies

$$
\lVert f(t,0)\rVert\longrightarrow0\qquad(t\to1^-).
$$

This is a formal certificate of residual cancellation, not a proof of force
singularity. It closes the force-explosion route and moves the live
falsification target back to CTR-005: the missing selected-path transport of
the paper's five moments and absolute pressure semantics.

## 1. Review question and standard

The audit asks three different questions.

1. Does Lean check the proposition written in the theorem declaration?
2. Does the declared proposition encode a valid Navier–Stokes construction?
3. Does that construction match the paper and one of Fefferman's stated CMI
   alternatives?

The first question is answered by kernel checking. The second and third
require inspection of definitions, hypotheses, interfaces, and the
mathematical transport between modules. Compilation alone cannot answer them.

The forced C/D alternatives permit a smooth external force. Therefore the
following proposed conditions are not CMI disproof criteria without extra
hypotheses:

$$
\int_{\mathbb R^3} f(x,t)\,dx=0,
\qquad
\nabla\cdot f=0.
$$

An external body force is not an internal Newtonian stress, and incompressibility
constrains $u$, not automatically $f$. These are physical-provenance tests,
not consequences of the written forced alternatives.

## 2. Source and method

The primary source is the review fork of the public
`NavierStokesAndEuler` development. The upstream source tree is not modified.
All review code is under `NavierStokesReview/src/probes`, and all conclusions
below are tied either to source declarations or to zero-sorry Lean probes.

The audit followed the selected path:

$$
\texttt{ActualCandidateAssembly.selected\_witness}
\to
\texttt{GermCandidateAssembly}
\to
\texttt{CandidateFromLimits}
\to
\texttt{R3CompactCandidate}
\to
\texttt{R3/Theorem}.
$$

The active document map is controlled by
[`REVIEW_DOCUMENT_CONTROL.md`](REVIEW_DOCUMENT_CONTROL.md). The evidence
directory contains the compiler outputs and source ledgers; this paper states
the mathematical conclusions rather than reproducing the audit log.

## 3. What the formal endpoint does establish

`NavierStokes/R3/ProblemStatement.lean` requires, among other properties,
pre-singular smooth velocity and pressure, incompressibility, an explicit
Newtonian residual equation, compact support conditions, zero initial velocity,
and unbounded speed as $t\to1^-$. The comparator theorem then rules out a
global finite-energy solution with the same force under the recorded
comparison hypotheses.

The selected dependency reports for `selected_witness`, the R3 theorem, the
actual physical data, and the residual rate theorem contain only Lean's
standard foundational axioms:

$$
\texttt{propext},\qquad \texttt{Classical.choice},\qquad \texttt{Quot.sound}.
$$

This is positive evidence about kernel provenance. It does not certify that
every analytic premise has the intended physical meaning.

The repository-wide statement that every file is admitted-free is false: the
standalone `ComparatorChallenges` modules contain four `sorry` declarations.
The current dependency audit does not place those declarations on the selected
R3 endpoint. The two facts must not be conflated.

## 4. Force construction and the smoothness attack

The force is residual-driven. Before the singular time,
`CandidateFromLimits.force` agrees with the activated residual

$$
\mathcal R(u,p)=\partial_tu+(u\cdot\nabla)u-\nu\Delta u+\nabla p.
$$

At the endpoint, a smooth extension is constructed from locally uniform
limits of all residual derivatives. `PositiveTimeForce` applies a genuine
smooth temporal cutoff and remains active through the singular interval; it
does not establish an autonomous collapse.

The proposed attack is mathematically meaningful: if the selected fields
satisfied a positive lower estimate

$$
c\,\lVert u(t,0)\rVert
\leq
\lVert\mathcal R(u,p)(t,0)\rVert,
\qquad c>0,
$$

then residual flatness at $t=1$ would contradict origin blow-up. The
zero-sorry probe
[`SelectedResidualLowerBoundObstructionProbe.lean`](../NavierStokesReview/src/probes/SelectedResidualLowerBoundObstructionProbe.lean)
proves exactly this conditional contradiction on the actual one-sided
endpoint filter.

The selected-path extraction and the zero residual limit are recorded in
[`SelectedWitnessEndpointResidualProbe.lean`](../NavierStokesReview/src/probes/SelectedWitnessEndpointResidualProbe.lean).

The selected source, however, also contains explicit core cancellation:
`FinalSlowBase.stressForce_core_germ` and its jet theorem make the stress-force
part vanish in the core, while the remaining error is controlled by flat jet
estimates. Thus the implication

$$
\lVert u(t,0)\rVert\to\infty
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
\lVert\mathcal R(u,p)(t,0)\rVert\to\infty
$$

has not been proved and is not a valid inference from norm growth alone. The
force-smoothness attack is closed as a force-explosion argument by the selected
force-origin composition result. A formal refutation now requires a different
incompatible selected-field identity or a false mandatory premise.

## 5. The flat residual is an all-order, debt-blind interface

The source definition of `VanishingJointJets` quantifies over every natural
order of the spacetime Fréchet derivative. Its selected construction is fed by
finite residual-rate estimates derived from the actual cycle invariant, then
passes through the schedule theorem and the mixed residual theorem. It is not
an `H^3` truncation.

The time switch is globally smooth, becomes identically one for
`t\geq3/4`, and has zero positive-order derivatives on that late region. The
spatial periodic and cut residuals agree with the original residual on a
neighbourhood of the origin. The comparison is made with the complete
Navier--Stokes residual, so the temporal derivative, advection, Laplacian, and
pressure-gradient terms are not projected away.

This regularity result does not resolve the review's central objection. The
localisation files contain no debt-vector parameter and no equality to the
paper's `(M,I,J,S,C_p)` moments. They provide debt-blind field identities, not
the missing selected moment-realisation theorem.

## 6. The five-moment correspondence objection

The upstream five-moment machinery is substantive. In
`PositiveOrderMoments.lean`, the history debt is

$$
\mathrm{Debt}=\mathrm{Fin}(5)\to\mathbb R,
$$

and `rowDensity` contains the five literal rows

$$
\begin{aligned}
&R u_n,\\
&R^2 e_n,\\
&\partial_R p_n,\\
&R^2\,\mathcal C_n(u,e),\\
&R\,\mathcal C_n(u,u)-\tfrac{R^2}{2}\partial_Rp_n.
\end{aligned}
$$

`moments_repair_target` proves exact repair to an arbitrary five-coordinate
target under its explicit radial hypotheses. `GlobalStressSupport` and the
aligned base construction use this machinery.

The runtime rank engine is a different interface. `FiveRowRank` declares

$$
\mathrm{Debt}=\mathrm{Fin}(3)\to\mathbb R,
$$

with coordinates $(P,J_\theta,J_z)$. Its proposition `FiveRows` has two
fixed zero-moment rows and three debt-controlled rows. `MeanRankUpdate.scaleDebt`
uses the coefficients

$$
\bigl(U^2d_0,\;\ell^3U^2d_1,\;\ell^2U^2d_2\bigr).
$$

The direct dimension objection is therefore insufficient. A zero-sorry probe
shows that the positive-order repair reduces to the rank repair under the
promotion

$$
(P,J_\theta,J_z)\longmapsto(0,0,-P,-J_\theta,-J_z).
$$

The actual adverse result is transport, not existence of repair code. The
exported `Witness` contains stage sums, away extensions, force predicates,
residual consequences, decay bounds, and boundary jets, but no equality of the
form

$$
\mathrm{moments}(u,e,p)=(M,I,J,S,C_p)
$$

and no theorem carrying such an equality into `StateRealization.chartIdentity`,
the selected residual, or the force. The source audit has not located that
selected-path theorem.

The zero-sorry probe
[`SelectedWitnessAttackBoundaryProbe.lean`](../NavierStokesReview/src/probes/SelectedWitnessAttackBoundaryProbe.lean)
proves the precise interface statement

$$
\neg\bigl(\mathrm{Witness}\Rightarrow
\forall d:\mathrm{Fin}(5)\to\mathbb R,\ d=0\bigr).
$$

This means the witness envelope cannot certify the paper's five-moment
transport by its type alone. It does not prove that the concrete selected
velocity violates the five integrals. That second statement needs a
field-level computation.

## 7. Pressure and localisation

The R3 packaging imposes compact support on pre-singular pressure slices.
Pressure-recovery modules prove genuine compact-test comparison identities,
and `StateRealization` supplies local pressure germs and a local residual
identity. These are not empty modules.

They do not, by their inspected interfaces, provide an absolute global
pressure representative satisfying the selected paper's claimed Poisson or
Leray semantics. In particular, the comparison hypotheses can be instantiated
with identical zero velocities and a common smooth pressure. The comparison
chain therefore cannot by its type alone certify the absolute selected
pressure.

Compact support alone is still not a contradiction. The external force is
allowed to absorb the pressure-gradient contribution in the forced residual.
To obtain `False`, the review must first prove a selected-field identity such
as

$$
-\Delta p=\nabla\!\cdot\nabla\!\cdot(u\otimes u-f\otimes I)
$$

with the required domain, normalisation, and decay hypotheses, and then show
that this identity is incompatible with the compact pressure predicate. The
current source does not expose that complete bridge. The pressure route is
therefore an open analytic correspondence objection, not a completed
trivialisation theorem.

## 8. Generic interfaces and countermodels

The generic `StageEstimates` record stores smoothness and finite jet-rate
bounds but no five-moment field integral. A zero-sorry probe inhabits this
record with identically zero velocity and pressure stages and proves that the
record does not determine an arbitrary five-coordinate debt. This refutes the
inference

$$
\texttt{StageEstimates}\Longrightarrow\text{five-moment realisation}.
$$

It does not refute `selected_witness`, which adds actual physical-data,
base-profile, endpoint, and origin-growth premises. Similarly, the generic
filter API permits vacuous statements over `Filter.bot`, but the selected
origin-past filter has been checked non-vacuous. The generic hazard is real;
selected-path exploitation has not been demonstrated.

## 9. Pressure response and the residual equation

The proposed equal-and-opposite pressure argument was tested against the
actual operator rather than treated as a general physical objection. The
residual is

$$
\mathcal R_\nu(u,p)=\partial_tu+(u\cdot\nabla)u-\nu\Delta u+\nabla p,
$$

and the candidate predicate requires `\mathcal R_\nu(u,p)=f`. The force is
therefore the full residual, not a separate term that the pressure equation
must cancel.

The zero-sorry probe
[`PressureResidualNonCancellationProbe.lean`](../NavierStokesReview/src/probes/PressureResidualNonCancellationProbe.lean)
compiles the exact perturbation identity

$$
\mathcal R(u+e,p+q)-\mathcal R(u,p)
=\partial_te-\Delta e+\nabla q
 +(u\cdot\nabla)e+(e\cdot\nabla)u+(e\cdot\nabla)e.
$$

In particular, for zero velocity,

$$
\mathcal R(0,q)-\mathcal R(0,0)=\nabla q.
$$

Thus a nonzero pressure gradient changes the residual; the formal operator
does not imply an equal-and-opposite cancellation. The pressure-recovery
modules are comparison results: they assume two divergence-free fields with
equal residuals and recover pressure differences through compact tests. They do
not impose an absolute Poisson representative for the selected fields.

For a forced incompressible equation, the divergence identity contains the
force term:

$$
\Delta p=\nabla\!\cdot f-
\nabla\!\cdot\bigl((u\cdot\nabla)u\bigr),
$$

when the required commutations are available. Dropping `\nabla\!\cdot f`
would silently replace the forced problem by an additional divergence-free
force assumption. That assumption is not part of the exported candidate
predicate.

The pressure route therefore yields a precise correspondence objection, not a
formal annihilation theorem: the selected path still lacks an explicit
absolute global pressure-Poisson/normalisation bridge, but the proposed
pressure cancellation has not been proved and is contradicted by the compiled
residual identity.

## 10. External-force causality

The official problem statement describes \(f(x,t)\) as a given, externally
applied force. The repository instead defines the final force from the selected
velocity, pressure, and residual-limit data. This is a real paper-to-code
causality mismatch: the construction is residual-designed, not a forward
initial-value argument in which an independently specified force is held fixed
while the velocity evolves.

The formal consequence must nevertheless be stated precisely. Fefferman's C/D
alternatives quantify over the existence of a smooth force satisfying the
specified decay conditions. They do not state an additional Lean-style
independence predicate forbidding the construction of that force from other
witness components. Once constructed, the residual-defined object is still a
function (f(x,t)). The CMI prize rules do not add such a causal predicate.

Therefore residual feedback is a serious objection to the physical
interpretation and to any claim that the code reproduces a prescribed-force
evolution. It is not, without an additional admissibility theorem or a false
mandatory endpoint predicate, a formal disproof of the literal existential C/D
proposition. The official-source adjudication is recorded in
[`cmi_force_independence_adjudication_2026-09-24.md`](../NavierStokesReview/evidence/cmi_force_independence_adjudication_2026-09-24.md).

The fixed-data test makes this objection mathematically sharper. Let (e) be
an independently chosen smooth perturbation, keep (p) and the spacetime
force (f) fixed, and require both (u) and (u+e) to satisfy the same
residual equation. The compiled theorem
[`IndependentDataPerturbationProbe.lean`](../NavierStokesReview/src/probes/IndependentDataPerturbationProbe.lean)
derives the necessary identity

$$
\partial_t e-\Delta e+(u\cdot\nabla)e+(e\cdot\nabla)u+(e\cdot\nabla)e=0.
$$

The extension module packages the stronger local conclusion: whenever this
defect is nonzero at one spacetime point, the perturbed field cannot satisfy
the same fixed force. This formally exposes the dependence of the
residual-designed force on its selected velocity path. It does not, however,
show that the selected existential witness must admit such a perturbation, and
therefore does not by itself derive `False` from the C/D endpoint.

The localisation objection has now been formalised rather than left at the
level of the affine test. `CompactFixedForcePerturbation.lean` constructs a
smooth compactly supported potential, takes its spatial curl, and forms a
time-affine perturbation. The resulting field is divergence-free on every
time slice. At the switch time its spatial value, first derivative, and
Laplacian vanish, while its temporal derivative at the origin is the nonzero
first coordinate vector. The theorem
`compactPerturbation_breaks_any_fixed_force_at_origin` proves that the base and
perturbed fields cannot satisfy the same residual equation with the same force.
This is a genuine localised fixed-data obstruction, but it remains an
operator-level result: the literal endpoint does not assert stability under
perturbation, so this theorem alone does not refute its existential quantifier.

The probe also contains a concrete test field

$$
e_a(t,x)=(t-t_0)a,qquad a\ne0.
$$

It proves this field is globally smooth and spatially divergence-free, and
computes its defect at (t=t_0) as exactly (a). Thus the same fixed force
cannot satisfy both the original and perturbed velocities. The field is not
compactly supported or finite-energy on (mathbb R^3), so this is an exact
operator-level causality obstruction rather than a direct CMI counterexample.

The correct CTR-012 conclusion is consequently two-layered. The construction
is not a forward prescribed-force stability result: changing the velocity
without recomputing the residual generally destroys the force identity. But a
single specially matched smooth triple ((u,p,f)) can still satisfy a literal
existential statement. A formal CMI disproof requires either an independence
condition in the theorem being claimed or a selected-path theorem that supplies
an admissible perturbation with nonzero defect. The exact proof and its limits
are recorded in
[`independent_data_perturbation_2026-09-24.md`](../NavierStokesReview/evidence/independent_data_perturbation_2026-09-24.md).

Other proposed objections remain outside the CMI disproof threshold unless a
selected-path theorem supplies their missing premise: active forcing, nonzero
force integral or divergence, non-Newtonian regularisation, pure-axial collapse,
and compact pressure support alone.

## 11. Verdict

The formal review establishes the following.

1. The selected Lean endpoint is a real forced C/D-shaped proposition and is
   standard-axiom-only in the inspected dependency reports.
2. The force is selected from the candidate residual and remains active near
   the singular time.
3. The repository contains genuine five-row repair mathematics, but the
   selected witness does not expose the paper's five-moment transport theorem.
4. The force-smoothness attack has a proved conditional contradiction, but its
   required selected-field lower bound is missing.
5. The pressure chain has comparison infrastructure, but compact support alone
   does not yield a pressure trivialisation contradiction.

The resulting verdict is:

> **The OpenAI claim is not established as a CMI solution by the inspected
> paper-to-code correspondence. A formal contradiction to the selected Lean
> witness has not yet been proved.**

The load-bearing objection is CTR-005: the missing selected-path transport of
the paper's five moments into the actual velocity, pressure, residual, and
force. The review should be upgraded to a formal refutation only after a
zero-sorry theorem derives `False` from the selected witness and its actual
premises, or proves a false mandatory endpoint predicate.

## 12. Closure correction and the surviving counter-argument

The five-moment objection is not that the repository lacks five-moment
mathematics. A transitive import traversal rooted at
`ActualCandidateAssembly.lean` reaches 507 local modules, including the
positive-order, profile, and rank subsystems. The source contains exact repair
identities and uses rank/debt data upstream of the selected endpoint.

The counter-argument is instead about semantic transport. The public `Witness`
proposition exposes the selected schedule, mixed sums, extensions, force,
candidate properties, consequences, blow-up norm, force decay, and boundary
jets. It does not expose an equality identifying the final mixed fields with
the paper's five quantities

$$
(M,I,J,S,C_p),
$$

nor a theorem carrying that equality into the residual, pressure, force, and
all-order jet estimates. The direct-germ interface is therefore weaker than
the paper's advertised five-moment semantics even though the upstream repair
system is substantive.

This is a genuine paper-to-endpoint correspondence failure and the strongest
current counter-paper result. It is not yet a formal `False` theorem: the
review has not shown that the concrete selected fields violate one of those
integral identities. The decisive next step is a field-level transport theorem
or a zero-sorry counterexample to one of its concrete equalities.

Evidence: `NavierStokesReview/evidence/selected_moment_transport_closure_2026-09-24.md`.

### The proposed rank-collision refutation

A stronger proposed refutation was tested: inject a compact perturbation into
the selected witness and use the two zero rows of `FiveRowRank.FiveRows` to
derive an impossible nonzero moment. The source does not support that
inference. The five-row predicate is a proposition about two correction
functions and a three-coordinate debt. Its theorem `five_rows` is inhabited
for arbitrary admissible debt, including nonzero debt. The correction-state
theorems preserve two radial moments, but do not state that those moments are
the selected field's kinetic energy or the paper's complete five-moment tuple.

The endpoint `Witness` contains no rank debt or perturbation parameter. Thus
the compact perturbation theorem cannot be substituted into the endpoint by
type unification, and no `False` theorem follows from the zero rows alone.
This negative result is useful: it removes an attractive but invalid shortcut
and leaves the substantive paper-to-code question in its proper form. The
missing theorem is a selected-path transport identity from
$(M,I,J,S,C_p)$ through the correction state and mixed sums into the residual,
pressure, and force. Evidence:
`NavierStokesReview/evidence/five_row_collision_boundary_2026-09-24.md`.

The runtime scope is now checked separately. `MeanRankUpdate.scaleDebt` has
three debt coordinates, and `FiveRows` constrains only two radial moments of
the correction functions before applying its three debt equations. A compiled
completion constructs a nonzero debt satisfying the full predicate. Thus the
review does not claim that the runtime rows hard-code total kinetic energy to
zero. The unresolved issue is the selected-path transport of the internal
correction data into the exported field and the paper's five named moments.
Evidence: `NavierStokesReview/evidence/mean_rank_update_scope_2026-09-24.md`.

### A conditional correction-moment obstruction

The zero rows are not empty syntax. They force two precise radial moments of
the correction increment to vanish. The new Lean completion
`CorrectionInvariantScope.lean` proves the corresponding conditional
refutation: if an increment transported into the rank subsystem has a nonzero
`barMoment 2` angular component or nonzero `barMoment 1` axial component, the
complete `FiveRows` predicate is inconsistent.

This is the strongest result presently available from the rank interface. It
does not, by itself, identify an externally chosen Cartesian perturbation with
the correction increment, nor does it identify the two radial moments with
kinetic energy or the paper's five named moments. The remaining theorem is
therefore concrete rather than rhetorical: transport the perturbation through
the selected stage construction, calculate one of these moments as nonzero,
and apply the conditional obstruction. Until that transport is proved, the
result is a load-bearing route to falsification, not a completed `False`
theorem for `selected_witness`.

### What the two zero rows actually preserve

The rank construction is stronger than a syntactic placeholder, but weaker
than the proposed energy argument. Its first two equations constrain the
increment functions themselves:

\[
\int R^2\,dv(R)=0,\qquad \int R\,ga(R)=0.
\]

The correction-state layer identifies these with two radial moments of the
updated angular and axial mean fields, and the generic rank theorem preserves
them from one rank stage to the next. This is a genuine conditional
obstruction: a correction increment with a nonzero corresponding moment cannot
satisfy the complete five-row system.

It is not, however, an energy identity. The source does not equate these
radial moments with total kinetic energy, the full Cartesian velocity, or the
paper's five quantities `(M,I,J,S,C_p)`. Nor does the selected `Witness`
export those moments. The remaining decisive task is therefore a semantic
transport theorem from the selected perturbation and mixed stage fields into
`rankIncrement`. If that theorem proves a nonzero radial moment, the
conditional `False` result closes the selected path; until then, the formal
finding is a correspondence failure under CTR-005, not a completed
refutation. Evidence:
`NavierStokesReview/evidence/correction_moment_transport_audit_2026-09-24.md`.

### Internal cycle invariant and the remaining endpoint gap

The source contains a further fact that must be distinguished from the
exported theorem interface. `ActualCyclePreservation.Invariant` is a
`CycleAnalyticInvariant` with a `masses` field. Its induction therefore proves
that every actual selected-cycle state has two local radial moments equal to
zero. The separate Lean completion exposes this invariant and proves that a
nonzero value of either corresponding selected-cycle moment is impossible.

This result removes an overly broad version of the “zero rows are ignored”
objection. The correction cycle does preserve the two quantities it names.
What remains unproved is the semantic transport from those internal mean
fields into the mixed velocity and pressure sums consumed by `Witness`, and
then into the five published quantities `(M,I,J,S,C_p)`. The local invariant
also says nothing by itself about total kinetic energy. The counter-paper's
load-bearing claim is consequently precise: the source has an internal
two-moment conservation theorem, but does not display the theorem that makes
it the paper's five-moment endpoint certificate. Evidence:
`NavierStokesReview/src/completions/SelectedCycleMomentTransport.lean`.

### Direct endpoint trace

The immediate source path sharpens this conclusion. `ActualCandidateAssembly`
does consume actual cycle data and residual estimates, while
`CorrectionState` proves the rank rows for the constructed correction. The
exported `Witness`, however, contains no equality to
`PositiveOrderMoments.moments`, `FiveProfileMoments.physicalMoments`,
`FiveRowRank.FiveRows`, or the named tuple `(M,I,J,S,C_p)`. The absence is not
evidence that those upstream identities are false; it is the absence of the
transport theorem needed to claim that the selected endpoint is the same
five-moment object described in the paper.

This distinction is recorded in
`NavierStokesReview/evidence/selected_endpoint_direct_source_trace_2026-09-24.md`.

### Temporal stage boundary audit

The indexed stage constructor deserves a separate statement. In
`GermCandidateAssembly.lean`, `initializedSeries` assigns the base plus initial
field to index zero and assigns `stages j` to index `j+1`. This leaves no
adjacent-stage matching condition at the constructor boundary. The finite-prefix
theorems in `ActualCandidateConstruction.lean` are additive identities, not
energy conservation laws and not temporal interpolation statements.

This is not merely a missing annotation. The supplementary theorem
`initialized_series_admits_concrete_boundary_mismatch` constructs a raw family
with zero base and initial fields and a nonzero first stage. It proves that the
indexed selector permits unequal adjacent entries. The construction is still
not a temporal counterexample: the index is a natural number, not time, and the
theorem does not assert the selected `StageEstimates`, support, divergence,
residual, or endpoint conditions.

That observation does not establish a discontinuity in the selected field.
The selected sums have presingular smoothness theorems, the time activation is
globally smooth, and late temporal derivatives agree by local eventual
equality. The correct conclusion is an open interface obligation: the review
has not found a theorem deriving a selected temporal boundary mismatch, so it
cannot call the temporal-patching route a formal refutation.

The exact ledger and zero-sorry probe are in
`NavierStokesReview/evidence/temporal_patching_audit_2026-09-24.md` and
`NavierStokesReview/src/probes/TemporalPatchingDiscontinuityProbe.lean`.

### Source context and causal wording

Fefferman describes the force as given and externally applied, which supports
a provenance objection to choosing a trajectory first and defining its
residual afterwards. OpenAI's own paper nevertheless makes that residual
construction explicit and states that the challenge is to make the residual
smooth through the singular time. The formal review therefore asks for the
missing semantic bridges rather than treating the construction method alone as
a contradiction of the existential C/D statement.

The companion Euler paper uses a parent-child sequence on nested time
intervals. That is useful context for what a genuine temporal induction looks
like, but it does not prove that the Navier--Stokes Lean stage index is a time
partition. The full source-context register is
`docs/OpenAI_NavierStokes_Source_Context_Register.md`.

The official CMI statement is correspondingly important in two ways. It calls
the force given and externally applied, which makes force provenance a serious
mathematical question. It also formulates alternatives C and D existentially,
with smooth force data satisfying the stated decay conditions. A perturbation
test or a sign-reversed force therefore cannot, by itself, refute the selected
existential witness. The decisive formal target remains a false mandatory
premise or a missing selected-path identity, especially the transport of the
five named moments and pressure semantics into the exported endpoint.

## Selected-witness fixed-force result

The fixed-force obstruction has now been instantiated on the actual selected
field. `selected_candidate_fixed_force_obstruction` destructs
`ActualCandidateAssembly.selected_witness`, binds its mixed velocity, pressure,
and force, and applies the selected residual equation at the interior point
$(t,x)=(1/2,0)$. The compact divergence-free perturbation has the explicit
nonzero defect `coordinateVector 0`, so the perturbed selected field cannot
satisfy the same fixed-force equation.

This closes the localisation gap in the operator test and strengthens CTR-012.
It does not make the literal C/D existential proposition empty: the endpoint
does not quantify over perturbations and does not require a force-independence
or perturbation-stability predicate. The result is therefore a selected-path
causality objection, not a global `False` theorem.

## Selected-force provenance closure

The causal criticism is now a proved property of the selected endpoint. The
zero-sorry extension `SelectedResidualProvenance.lean` extracts the selected
velocity, pressure, and force and proves the interior identity

$$
f(t,x)=\partial_tu+(u\cdot\nabla)u-\Delta u+\nabla p.
$$

Thus the construction is a residual-designed trajectory, not an independently
specified force followed through a forward Cauchy evolution. This sharpens the
causal criticism and explains why the compact fixed-force perturbation is a
valid diagnostic. It does not, by itself, make the existential C/D predicate
inconsistent, because that predicate contains no formal force-independence or
perturbation-stability condition. The remaining decisive work is a selected
five-moment or pressure identity whose required premises are false, or a
direct contradiction in the selected endpoint.

### Runtime rank correction

The runtime rank audit narrows the five-moment objection. The rank layer is
not dead code: `MeanRankUpdate.physical_five_rows` and
`CorrectionState.rank_model_rows` apply the three-debt repair to the actual
cycle, and the two zero rows preserve two named radial correction moments.
Those rows do not state that total kinetic energy is zero, nor do they by
themselves identify the final Cartesian field with the paper's five quantities.

The unresolved issue is the selected-endpoint transport theorem. The exported
`Witness` contains no equality connecting the internal correction moments to
`(M,I,J,S,C_p)` and then to the mixed velocity, pressure, residual, and force.
The correct conclusion is therefore a material paper-to-code correspondence
failure, not a claim that the rank construction is absent or that Lean has
already derived `False`.

## Whole-space comparison: a cleared overstatement

The whole-space endpoint cannot accurately be described as a candidate-only
existential wrapper. The source proves comparison on every closed interval
before the singular time. It derives the pressure flux from the two residual
equations and incompressibility using compact spatial tests, then closes the
weighted energy estimate under the stated finite-energy hypotheses. The
selected candidate is supplied to this theorem by
`candidate_global_agrees_before_one`; compact support and speed unboundedness
then exclude a global finite-energy competitor.

This does not resolve the separate semantic question about the force being
chosen from the candidate residual, nor does it expose an absolute global
pressure representative. It does mean that the review must not present the
R³ no-global-solution conclusion as dead code, an uninhabited wrapper, or a
pressure-support trivialisation. The remaining formal objection is the missing
selected-path transport of the paper's named moments and pressure semantics.

Evidence: [`whole_space_uniqueness_audit_2026-09-24.md`](../NavierStokesReview/evidence/whole_space_uniqueness_audit_2026-09-24.md).

## A formal fixed-force stability test

The review includes a separate semantic extension that makes the forward-data
interpretation explicit. `FixedForceStable` requires a single force and
pressure to satisfy the residual equation after every smooth, compactly
supported, divergence-free perturbation of the velocity. The selected
candidate fails this strengthened condition: at $(t,x)=(1/2,0)$, the compact
perturbation produces the nonzero defect `coordinateVector 0` while the force
is held fixed.

This result sharpens the causal interpretation of the residual construction,
but it must not be overstated. The literal C/D endpoint does not contain this
stability or independence predicate. The theorem therefore does not derive
`False` from the published existential statement. It records a formal
failure of the stronger forward-data reading and leaves the selected
five-moment transport theorem under CTR-005 as the principal unresolved
correspondence target.

Evidence: [`fixed_force_stability_extension_2026-09-24.md`](../NavierStokesReview/evidence/fixed_force_stability_extension_2026-09-24.md).

## Reachability of the active stage layer

The stage-control implementation contains an explicit case split for an
empty active-pair type. This is not, by itself, evidence that the selected
Navier--Stokes construction is vacuous. The review extension
`SelectedActivePairReachability.lean` proves that every concrete selected
label yields an active pair at its own band because

$$
\mathrm{cellBand}(L)\in\mathrm{CommonWindow.levels}(\mathrm{cellBand}(L)).
$$

The proof does not establish that the selected label subtype is inhabited at
the exported endpoint. The formal status is therefore asymmetric: concrete
label reachability is proved, while selected-label inhabitance remains an
interface question. A claim that the empty branch produces the published
blow-up would require the missing inhabitance result or a false selected-field
identity.

## External force language and the formal target

The official formulation calls $f$ a given, externally applied force and
requires derivative decay estimates. OpenAI's release describes the same
balance as a smooth applied force remaining regular while velocity grows. The
selected force is nevertheless obtained from the candidate residual on the
interior interval, so the provenance criticism is mathematically substantive.
The formal endpoint does not add a force-independence or perturbation-
stability predicate. The review therefore distinguishes:

1. the selected force is residual-designed;
2. the selected candidate fails the stronger fixed-force perturbation-stability
   property; and
3. the literal C/D existential endpoint is inconsistent.

The first two are proved on the review side. The third still requires a false
mandatory endpoint premise or a concrete selected-field contradiction.
